### What I Learned

I reinforced my understanding of:

```html
<h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
```
```css
.container {
  background-color: white;
  padding: 2rem;
  border-radius: 10px;
  text-align: center;
  width: 20%;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to:

- Improve accessibility with ARIA tags.
- Experiment more with CSS Grid layouts.
- Practice BEM methodology for class naming.
